## Project Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing whole-slide imaging mass cytomegry (IMC-WS) images in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) datasets.

- single-cell segmentation is not possible, pixel-level data
- trained CNN on (insert stats) WS-IMC and (insert stats) TMA-IMC images for feature extraction of sliding windows
- evaluate information gain/adequacy of TMA-based approaches for assessing spatial heterogeneity

...

## Workflow

The pipeline consists of the following main steps:

**1. Configuration:**

**2. Preprocessing:**

**3. Feature Extraction**

**4. Clustering:**

**5. Downstream Analysis:**

**6. Evaluation of TMA-IMC:**
